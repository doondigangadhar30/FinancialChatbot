Financial Chatbot Prototype Documentation

1. Overview:
This chatbot prototype responds to predefined financial queries about Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple using data from their 10-K filings. It is designed to provide quick, accurate responses for an AI-powered financial chatbot.

2. Predefined Queries:
The chatbot handles the following queries (case-insensitive, must include company name):
- "What is the total revenue for [Company]?"
- "How has net income changed for [Company]?"
- "What is the total assets for [Company]?"
- "What is the cash flow from operating activities for [Company]?"
- "What is the financial health of [Company]?"

3. Functionality:
- Loads financial data from a CSV file (financial_data.csv) created in the previous task.
- Uses pandas to calculate year-over-year changes for metrics like net income.
- Matches user input to predefined queries using if-else logic and returns formatted responses.
- Runs in a command-line interface using Python's input() function.

4. Limitations:
- Only responds to specific queries for Microsoft, Tesla, or Apple.
- Requires exact phrasing with company names for accurate matching.
- Relies on a pre-existing CSV file with correct financial data.
- No natural language processing; limited to rule-based logic.
- Command-line only, no web interface.

5. How to Run:
- Ensure Python, pandas, and the CSV file (financial_data.csv) are available.
- Run the script: `python financial_chatbot.py`
- Enter queries or type 'exit' to quit.

6. Test Results:
- Tested with queries like "What is the total revenue for Apple?" and "How has net income changed for Tesla?".
- Successfully returned responses based on placeholder data (update with actual CSV data for accurate results).
